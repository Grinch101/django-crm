# django-crm

A simplified CRM using Django. This CRM can hold user authentication and provide a space for the user to add their customer/contact information. Along with each contact, user can add some activity to it with date and etc. I used JSON WEB TOKEN for authentication in this CRM.

Database used in this project is PostgreSQL and can be setup by runnig /migraion/1.SQL
